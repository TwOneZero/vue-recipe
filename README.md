# vue-search-meals

Learned Vue3 with Vite. Tried to implement basic functions using the Vue Composition API.
I Used an Open API at [Public API](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis), especially [The Meal DB](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php)

### Features

> 1. List Recipes.
> 2. Search by first letter of name.
> 3. Search by name, ingredient.
>
> - **If you need other features, check out The Meal DB site.**
